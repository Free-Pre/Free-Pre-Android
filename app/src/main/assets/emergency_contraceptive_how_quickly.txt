Emergency contraception works best when you use it as soon as possible after unprotected sex. If you are unable to take it right away, emergency contraception can still work to prevent pregnancy if taken up to three to five days after unprotected sex. How long after depends on which type of emergency contraception you use.

Take Plan B One-Step® or a generic version as soon as possible within three days (or 72 hours) after unprotected sex.
For the two-dose version (Next Choice®, LNG tablets 0.75 mg), take one pill as soon as possible within 3 days and the second pill 12 hours later.
Take ella® (ulipristal acetate) as soon as possible within five days (or 120 hours) after unprotected sex.
