Tampons come in different “sizes” (absorbencies), like light, regular, and super. It’s best to use the lowest or lightest absorbency that lasts you a few hours. Some tampons come with applicators — small sticks made of cardboard or plastic that help you put the tampon in your vagina. And some tampons don’t have an applicator, so you just put them in with your finger.

● Wash your hands and get into a comfortable position. You can squat, put one leg up, or sit on the toilet with your knees apart.
● Push the tampon into your vagina using the applicator or your finger, depending on what kind of tampon you have.
- Inserting a tampon in your vagina is more comfortable if you’re relaxed. Using tampons with smooth, rounded applicators may make it easier. You can also put a little bit of lubricant on the tip of the tampon or applicator. If you’re having trouble, ask someone you trust (like your mom, sister, or another person you trust who has used tampons) to show you how to put the tampon into your vagina.
● Throw the wrapper and applicator in the trash — don’t flush them.
