Period underwear (AKA period panties) are just like regular underwear, except they have extra layers of fabric that absorb your menstrual blood during your period. There are different kinds of period underwear for light, medium, or heavy flow days. You can wear period panties on their own, or with a tampon or menstrual cup.
