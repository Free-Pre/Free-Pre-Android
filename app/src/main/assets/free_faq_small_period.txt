Causes
● Age
Your period can vary in length and flow if you are in your teenage years. On the flip side, if you are in menopause, you may experience irregular periods that are light in flow. These occurrences are the result of hormonal imbalances.

● Weight and diet
Body weight and body fat percentage can affect your period. Being extremely underweight can cause your period to become irregular because your hormones are not working normally. Additionally, losing or gaining an extreme amount of weight can cause irregularities with your period.

● Pregnancy
If you are pregnant, it is unlikely that you will have a period. You may notice some spotting and think it’s your period, but it may actually be implantation bleeding. This can occur when a fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus. Implantation bleeding usually lasts for two days or less.

● Breast-feeding
If you are breast-feeding, your periods may not come back immediately after you give birth. The milk production hormone prevents ovulation and delays your period from returning. You may get your period months after giving birth if you are breast-feeding.

● Birth control
Hormonal birth control may be the cause of a light period.

● Stress
If you’re stressed, your brain can alter the menstrual cycle hormones. You may experience skipped or lighter periods because of it. Once a stressful event passes, your periods should return to normal.

● Overexercising
Women who exercise frequently may experience changes to their period. Athletes can be under stress, have low body weight, and use a lot of body energy. This can result in altered periods.

● Eating disorders
Anorexia nervosa and bulimia are types of eating disorders that may cause irregular periods. Eating disorders can lead to low body weight, which can alter hormones that regulate your period.
