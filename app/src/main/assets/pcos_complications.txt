Complications of PCOS can include:

● Infertility
● Gestational diabetes or pregnancy-induced high blood pressure
● Miscarriage or premature birth
● Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis — a severe liver inflammation caused by fat buildup in the liver
● Metabolic syndrome — a cluster of conditions including high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and unhealthy cholesterol or triglyceride levels that significantly increase your risk of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease
● Type 2 diabetes or prediabetes
● Sleep apnea
● Depression, anxiety and eating disorders
● Cancer of the uterine lining (endometrial cancer)

Obesity commonly occurs with PCOS and can worsen complications of the disorder.
