Tampons and cups can’t get stuck, get lost inside you, or move to another part of your body. The muscles in your vagina hold them in place (without you even knowing!), and they stay inside your body until you take them out. Most people can’t feel tampons or cups at all when they’re in the right spot. You can wear tampons and cups in the water, and during all kinds of sports and activities.
