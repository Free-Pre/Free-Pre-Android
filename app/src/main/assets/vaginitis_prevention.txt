Good hygiene might prevent some types of vaginitis from recurring and relieve some symptoms:

● Avoid baths, hot tubs and whirlpool spas.
● Avoid irritants. These include scented tampons, pads, douches and scented soaps. Rinse soap from your outer genital area after a shower and dry the area well to prevent irritation. Don't use harsh soaps, such as those with deodorant or antibacterial action, or bubble bath.
● Wipe from front to back after using the toilet. Doing so avoids spreading fecal bacteria to your vagina.
● Avoid douching. Your vagina doesn't require cleansing other than regular showering. Repetitive douching disrupts the good organisms that live in the vagina and can increase your risk of vaginal infection. Douching won't clear up a vaginal infection.
● Wear cotton underwear. Also wear pantyhose with a cotton crotch. Consider not wearing underwear to bed. Yeast thrives in moist environments.
