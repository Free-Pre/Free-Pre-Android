Wear your period underwear on days when you’re bleeding. You can wash your period underwear in the washing machine, the same way you wash the rest of your underwear. Your period underwear will come with instructions that explain the best way to wash them.
If you have a heavy flow or you’re wearing light-flow period underwear, you may need to change your period underwear more often than once a day, or get some extra help from a tampon, pad, or menstrual cup.
