If a tampon is in your vagina for a long time it can cause an illness called toxic shock syndrome (TSS). TSS is really rare, but dangerous. If you’re using a tampon and have vomiting, a high fever, diarrhea, muscle aches, a sore throat, dizziness, faintness or weakness, and a sunburn-type rash, take the tampon out and call your doctor right away. To help prevent TSS, use the lowest absorbency tampon you can and change your tampon every 4-8 hours or as often as needed.
Putting in a tampon usually doesn’t hurt, but it may take some practice in the beginning. Try different kinds until you figure out what you like best, but don’t wear tampons unless you’re actually having your period.
If putting in a tampon is very painful, talk with a doctor or nurse about it. You may have a medical condition, or it may be that your hymen is covering the opening to your vagina. Either way, a doctor or nurse can help you figure out why it’s causing pain and figure out what to do about it.
