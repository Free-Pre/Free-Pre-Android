1. Wash your hands and get into a comfortable position. You can squat, put one leg up, or sit on the toilet with your knees apart.
2. Squeeze or fold the cup so it’s narrow, and slide it into your vagina with your fingers. Use the directions that came with your cup to figure out the best way to squeeze it and how to place the cup.
- Putting a cup in your vagina is more comfortable if you’re relaxed. If you’re having trouble, ask someone you trust (like your mom, sister, or another person you trust) to show you how to put it in your vagina.
3. Some cups need to be put high into your vagina, near your cervix. Others sit in the lower part of your vagina. If your cup is uncomfortable or in the wrong spot, take it out and try again.
4. You wear a menstrual cup for 8-12 hours at a time, or until it’s full.
5. Some menstrual cups have a little stem that you pull on to take it out. Others are removed by hooking a finger around the rim, squeezing it, and pulling it out.
