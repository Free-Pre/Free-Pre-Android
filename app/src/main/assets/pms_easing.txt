While there’s no cure for PMS, you can take steps to ease your symptoms.

● exercise regularly
● eat a healthy, balanced diet – you may find that eating frequent smaller meals (every 2-3 hours) suits you better than eating 3 larger meals a day
● get plenty of sleep – 7 to 8 hours is recommended
● try reducing your stress by doing yoga or meditation
● take painkillers such as ibuprofen or paracetamol to ease the pain
● keep a diary of your symptoms for at least 2 to 3 menstrual cycles
● Doctors base the diagnosis on symptoms, which a woman is usually asked to record daily.
