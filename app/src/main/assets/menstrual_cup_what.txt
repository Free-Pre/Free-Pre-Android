Menstrual cups are shaped like little bells or bowls, and they’re made of rubber, silicone, or soft plastic. You wear the cup inside your vagina, and it collects menstrual blood. Most cups are reusable — you just empty it when you need to, wash it, and use it again. Other menstrual cups are disposable — you throw it away after one use or one period cycle.
If you have an IUD, don’t use a menstrual cup. Using a menstrual cup can cause your IUD to move out of place.
