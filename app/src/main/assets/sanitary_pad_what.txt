Sanitary pads are narrow pieces of material that you stick to your underwear. Some have “wings” or flaps that fold over the sides of your underwear to protect against leaks and stains. Some pads are made out of disposable materials — you use them once and throw them away. Other pads are made from fabric, and can be washed and reused.
