Some people experience symptoms of menstruation and others don’t. The intensity of these symptoms can also vary. The most common symptom is cramps. The cramping you feel in your pelvic area is your uterus contracting to release its lining.

Other signs you’re getting your period are:

● Mood changes.
● Trouble sleeping.
● Headache.
● Food cravings.
● Bloating.
● Breast tenderness.
● Acne.
