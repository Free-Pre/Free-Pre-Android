The combined pill is 99.7 per cent effective, if taken correctly. Nearly one in ten women (9 per cent) taking the Pill may still get pregnant. The effectiveness is reduced because women take it irregularly, or because they have diarrhoea and vomiting, or they take medicine that can affect pill absorption. You are not protected against pregnancy until you have taken hormonal pills for seven days. It is important to not be more than 24 hours late when taking the combined pill.
