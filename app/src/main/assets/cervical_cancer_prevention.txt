To reduce your risk of cervical cancer:
Prevention
● Ask your doctor about the HPV vaccine.
The CDC(The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)recommends that all 11- and 12-year-olds receive two doses of HPV vaccine at least six months apart. Younger adolescents ages 9 and 10 and teens ages 13 and 14 also can receive vaccination on the two-dose schedule. Research has shown that the two-dose schedule is effective for children under 15.
Teens and young adults who begin the vaccine series later, at ages 15 through 26, should receive three doses of the vaccine.
The CDC recommends catch-up HPV vaccinations for all people through age 26 who aren't adequately vaccinated.

● Have routine Pap tests.
● Practice safe sex.
● Don't smoke.
