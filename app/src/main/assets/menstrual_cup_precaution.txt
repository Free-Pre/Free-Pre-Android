Putting in a cup shouldn’t hurt, but it may take some practice in the beginning. It may even take a couple of periods until you feel like you’ve gotten the hang of it. You can wear a pad as a backup in case your cup leaks, but you can’t wear a tampon and a cup at the same time.
If putting in a cup is very painful, talk with a doctor or nurse about it. You may have a medical condition, or it may be that your hymen is covering the opening to your vagina. Either way, a doctor or nurse can help you figure out why it’s causing pain and figure out what to do about it.
