The most common types of vaginitis are:

● Bacterial vaginosis. This results from an overgrowth of the bacteria naturally found in your vagina, which upsets the natural balance.
● Yeast infections. These are usually caused by a naturally occurring fungus called Candida albicans.
● Trichomoniasis. This is caused by a parasite and is often sexually transmitted.

Treatment depends on the type of vaginitis you have.
